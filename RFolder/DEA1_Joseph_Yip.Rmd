```{r load packages}
#load different libraries and function to enable us to complete this analysis
library(readr)
library(tidyr) #enables piping
library(dplyr)#enables enhancement to cleanse data
library(ggplot2)
library(caret) #enaables classfication and regression training

#how do i not print the code #echo off

```

```{r load data sets}
#uploads the data into R to start analysis
#shijo can you take the link of where we pull the CSV directly from Github?

```{r 1. How many breweries are present in each state}
#This code will identify the number of breweries for each state
#How many Breweries are in each state?

SummaryBrewery <- Breweries %>% count(State, sort = TRUE)
names(SummaryBrewery)[2] <- "Brewery Count"
#Summary of Breweries 
SummaryBrewery

```


```{r 2&3. Data Merge and clean}
#This code will merge the Data with assigning each beer with the brewery and location

#Merge Data
#outer join (keep all observations from both dataframes)
names(Beers)[5] <- "Brew_ID"
names(Breweries)[2] <- "Brewery Name"
bbdf <- merge(Beers,Breweries, by = "Brew_ID")

#Cleanse data
#need to figure out how to fill in the IBU, I thnk we can use Style and ABV to formulate the IBU for those empty spots


#clean age

```

```{r 4. Median of alcohol content and bitterness by each state.}
#This code will create a table of Medians for ABV and IBU for each state and graphically display a bar chart (how would a bar chart do that? wouldn't a box plot be better? Question to ask)
#Table and bar chart of alcohol



```

```{r 5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?}
#This code will identify which State has the highest ABV and IBU beers.



```

```{r 6.Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.}
#This code will create a summary statistic of the ABV variable


```


```{r 7. Shijo magic}
